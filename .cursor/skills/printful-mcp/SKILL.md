| Category | Tools | Common Use Cases |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| 🛍️ **Catalog** (5) | Browse, search, pricing | "Show me all t-shirts under $15" |

## Common Workflows

### 1. Product Discovery Workflow

**User asks:** "Find me a product to print my design on"

**Steps:**
1. **Browse catalog** by category or technique
2. **Check availability** for specific variants
3. **Get pricing** in user's currency
4. **Show variants** (sizes/colors)

**Example prompts to use:**
```
"Show me all hoodies available for DTG printing"
"What sizes does product 71 come in?"
"How much is variant 4011 in USD?"
"Is this variant in stock?"
```

### 2. Order Creation Workflow

**User asks:** "Create an order for my customer"

**Steps:**
1. **Create draft order** with recipient details
2. **Add items** (if not done in creation)
3. **Calculate shipping** (optional, for transparency)
4. **Confirm order** to start fulfillment

**Example prompts:**
```
"Create draft order for John Doe, 123 Main St, Los Angeles CA 90001"
"Calculate shipping to that address"
"Confirm order ID 12345"
```

**⚠️ Important:** Orders are created as DRAFTS. Must be explicitly confirmed to start production.

### 3. Mockup Generation Workflow

**User asks:** "Show me how my design looks on a product"

**Steps:**
1. **Create mockup task** with design URL and product details
2. **Wait 10-30 seconds** (mockup generation takes time)
3. **Check task status** to get mockup URLs
4. **Display mockups** to user

**Example prompts:**
```
"Generate mockup for product 71 with my design at https://example.com/design.png"
"Check status of mockup task 597350033"
```

**⚠️ Note:** Mockup generation is async. Always check status after creating task.

### 4. Store Analysis Workflow

**User asks:** "How's my store doing?"

**Steps:**
1. **List stores** (if multiple)
2. **Get statistics** for target store
3. **Present metrics** clearly

**Example prompts:**
```
"Show all my Printful stores"
"What are the sales stats for store 14690720?"
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

**1. Use natural language queries**
```
✅ "Show me all t-shirts under $15"
✅ "Create order for John at 123 Main St, LA"
✅ "How much to ship to UK?"
```

**2. Check availability before ordering**
```
✅ First: "Is variant 4011 in stock?"
✅ Then: "Create order with variant 4011"
```

**3. Wait for mockup generation**
```
✅ Create task → Wait 15-30s → Check status
❌ Create task → Immediately check status (will be pending)
```

**4. Use external IDs for order tracking**
```
✅ Create order with external_id="my-shop-order-789"
✅ Reference as @my-shop-order-789 later
```

**5. Request markdown format for readability**
```
✅ Most tools support format="markdown" (default)
✅ Use format="json" only for programmatic processing
```

### ❌ Avoid This

**1. Don't guess product/variant IDs**
```
❌ "Order variant 9999999" (probably doesn't exist)
✅ "Search for hoodies first, then order"
```

**2. Don't skip draft order confirmation**
```
❌ Creating order and assuming it's sent to production
✅ Create draft → Review → Explicitly confirm
```

**3. Don't exceed rate limits**
```
❌ Making 100+ requests in quick succession
✅ Batch operations, space out requests
Rate limit: 120 requests per 60 seconds
```

**4. Store ID is NOT required for most operations**
```
✅ Catalog, orders, mockups, shipping, files → No store_id needed
✅ Only printful_get_store_stats requires store_id as a parameter
✅ Single-store API tokens work without any store configuration
⚠️ PRINTFUL_STORE_ID env var only needed for multi-store account tokens
```

## Troubleshooting

### "PRINTFUL_API_KEY environment variable is required"
**Solution:** API key not configured in MCP settings
- Check `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or Claude Desktop config
- Ensure `PRINTFUL_API_KEY` is set in `env` section

### "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution:** Wait 60 seconds, then retry
- Default limit: 120 requests/minute
- Implement pauses between bulk operations

### "Resource not found"
**Solution:** ID doesn't exist or wrong format
- For orders: Use actual order ID or @external_id format
- For products: Browse catalog first to get valid IDs

### "This API endpoint applies only to Printful stores"
**Solution:** Using sync product tools with third-party store
- Sync products only work with native Printful stores
- Not compatible with Etsy, Shopify, WooCommerce stores

### Mockup stuck on "pending"
**Solution:** Wait longer or check for errors
- Normal wait time: 10-30 seconds
- After 2 minutes: Task likely failed, check error message

### mcporter / HTTP bridge param serialization errors
**Problem:** Tools work in Cursor/Claude Desktop but fail via mcporter or other HTTP-to-stdio bridges
**Cause:** Param serialization differs between direct stdio and HTTP bridges

**Solutions:**
1. **Use JSON format** (recommended):
```bash
mcporter call printful_mcp.printful_list_catalog_products --args '{"limit":20}'
mcporter call printful_mcp.printful_get_product --args '{"product_id":71}'
```

2. **Use typed values** (colon syntax for numbers):
```bash
mcporter call printful_mcp.printful_get_product product_id:71
# NOT: product_id=71 (sends string "71" instead of integer 71)
```

3. **Use HTTP transport** (bypasses mcporter's stdio bridge):
```bash
# Start server with HTTP transport
python -m printful_mcp --transport http --port 8000

# Server runs on http://localhost:8000/mcp (StreamableHTTP)
# Connect HTTP-compatible MCP clients directly
```

## Output Format Guidelines

When presenting results to users:

**For product lists:**
```markdown
Found 5 t-shirts:
1. Bella Canvas 3001 - $5.95 (DTG)
2. Gildan 5000 - $4.50 (DTG)
...
```

**For orders:**
```markdown
Order #12345 created (DRAFT)
- Recipient: John Doe
- Address: 123 Main St, Los Angeles CA 90001
- Status: Draft (not yet sent to production)

Next step: Confirm order to start fulfillment
```

**For shipping rates:**
```markdown
Shipping to UK:
- Standard: $8.50 (7-14 business days)
- Express: $15.00 (3-5 business days)
```

**For errors:**
```markdown
❌ Error: Rate limit exceeded
⏱️ Wait 45 seconds and try again
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Bulk Product Lookup
```
For each product in user's list:
1. Get product details
2. Check availability
3. Get pricing
4. Present summary table
```

### Order Validation Flow
```
1. Calculate shipping first
2. Show customer total cost
3. Get user confirmation
4. Create order
5. Confirm order
```

### Multi-Store Management
```
1. List all stores
2. Get stats for each
3. Compare performance
4. Present consolidated view
```

## API Version Notes

- **Primary:** API v2 (beta, but production-ready)
- **Fallback:** API v1 for sync products
- **Auto-switching:** Server handles version selection
- **Future-proof:** v2 will become standard

## Quick Tips

💡 **Always use markdown format** for user-facing results
💡 **Wait 15-30 seconds** after creating mockup tasks
💡 **Confirm orders explicitly** - drafts don't auto-confirm
💡 **Use external IDs** for easier order tracking
💡 **Check availability** before creating orders
💡 **Batch operations** to avoid rate limits
💡 **Validate addresses** with `printful_list_countries` first
